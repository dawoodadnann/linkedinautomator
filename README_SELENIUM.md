2. Review generated comments
3. Change Status to "approved" for comments you want to post

### Step 3: Run Automation
```bash
python linkedin_auto_commenter.py
```

The script will:
1. Read your Google Sheet
2. Find all approved posts
3. Open Chrome and wait for you to log in
4. Navigate to each post and comment
5. Update status to "Commented" or "Failed"

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Credentials**
   - Never share `credentials.json`
   - Never commit it to Git (included in `.gitignore`)
   
2. **LinkedIn Terms of Service**
   - Use responsibly
   - Don't spam or post irrelevant comments
   - Keep sessions under 50 posts
   
3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Default: 5 seconds between posts
   - Increase for safer automation
   - Monitor for LinkedIn warnings

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Google Sheets Connection Issues

**Error: "Could not connect to Google Sheets"**

Solutions:
- Verify `credentials.json` is in the correct folder
- Check you've shared the sheet with service account email
- Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled in Cloud Console

### Selenium/Chrome Issues

**Error: "ChromeDriver version mismatch"**

Solutions:
```bash
pip install webdriver-manager
```

Or download matching ChromeDriver from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

**Error: "Could not find comment box"**

Solutions:
- Ensure you're fully logged in to LinkedIn
- Check if LinkedIn changed their HTML structure
- Try scrolling to the comment section manually first
- Increase wait times in the script

### LinkedIn Issues

**Comments not posting**

Solutions:
- Verify you're logged in correctly
- Check if LinkedIn has rate-limited you (wait 24 hours)
- Ensure posts are public and allow comments
- Try posting manually first to test

---

## üìà Performance & Limits

### Recommended Limits
- **Posts per session:** 20-30 maximum
- **Wait time between posts:** 5-10 seconds minimum
- **Sessions per day:** 2-3 maximum
- **Total comments per day:** 50-80 maximum

### Speed vs Safety
- **Faster** (3 sec delays) = Higher risk of detection
- **Safer** (10 sec delays) = More natural, lower risk
- **Recommended:** 5-7 seconds between posts
