### What You'll See in Your Google Sheet

Each processed post will add a new row with:
- **Column A (Post Link)**: The full URL of the LinkedIn post
- **Column B (Comment)**: The AI-generated comment

## Configuration

### DeepSeek API Key
The API key is already configured in `background.js`:
```javascript
const DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "sk-eee1fb6f86764537ac4098a6e5bedb42";
```

### Google Sheets Web App URL
You need to add your Web App URL in `background.js`:
```javascript
const GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEB_APP_URL = "YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE";
```

## Removed Features

The following features were removed as requested:
- ❌ Approval popup for comments
- ❌ Posting comments directly on LinkedIn
- ❌ Sending connection requests to post authors
- ❌ Downloading connection requests CSV

## Stop Button

The stop button functionality has been preserved. Clicking "Stop Process" will:
- Cancel the current engagement run
- Close any open tabs
- Stop processing remaining posts

## Notes

- The extension uses `no-cors` mode for Google Apps Script requests, which is required for cross-origin requests to Apps Script web apps
- Comments are generated using the existing DeepSeek AI integration
- The timeout for each post is 60 seconds (reduced from 2 minutes since we removed the approval step)
- Posts are processed sequentially with a 2-second delay between each post
