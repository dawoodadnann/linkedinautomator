## 📊 Google Sheet Format

Your sheet should look like this:

| Post Link | Comment | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abc-123 | Great insights! | **approved** |
| https://www.linkedin.com/posts/def-456 | Thanks for sharing! | **approved** |
| https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ghi-789 | Interesting! | pending |

**Key Points:**
- Only rows with Status = "approved" will be processed
- After commenting, Status changes to "Commented"
- If it fails, Status changes to "Failed"
